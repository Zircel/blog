  h2 Who is “Stiftung Wendepunkt”?
  p Stiftung Wendepunkt is a non-profit organization that helps people in unfortunate life-situations to find their way back to society. Their activities include programs for temporary asylum and job seekers, long-term jobs, coaching, assisted living and many more.

  h1 How did Zircel make a difference?
  p To boost their business activities they were looking for a tool to increase productivity, communication and user engagement. That’s how Zircel came into the picture. With Zircel’s platform, they were able to create different use cases which improve communication internally and externally and which transform tasks into something fun to do. 

  h2 1. Use Case: Online onboarding of new participants
  p Wendepunkt hosts multiple events for their participants, one of them being an introduction day for new people. 

  p In the introduction, new participants learn about the company, receive important information and get an overview of how everything works. To assess whether the participant understood all info given and to see if there exists feedback an online application was needed. With Zircel they found themselves with a solution that makes the gathering and spreading of information easier, faster and more fun. 

  p As a result, they established a better connection to their participants as well as a more efficient way of data gathering.

  h2 2. Use Case: Internal repository for customer relationship management (CRM) tool
  p Moreover, they used Zircel as a survey tool, to get info and feedback about an administrative question. So for example they want to know how many people still use a Fax machine etc.

  p Being unable to match the answer to the right end users, this was their least successful implementation. In the future this could be prevented in two ways: Firstly, through a better analytics which allows a better mapping of data to a single user and secondly, through more precise questions which allow better data analysis.

  p As a result, they increased communication and efficiency internally and created an online repository for a new tool .

  h2 3. Use Case: Classical survey 
  p Moreover, they used Zircel as a survey tool, to get info and feedback about an administrative question. So for example they want to know how many people still use a Fax machine etc.
 
  p Being unable to match the answer to the right end users, this was their least successful implementation. In the future this could be prevented in two ways: Firstly, through a better analytics which allows a better mapping of data to a single user and secondly, through more precise questions which allow better data analysis.

  p Besides the identification problem they noticed that they would get more feedback from people that were into new technologies and therefore had a good time filling out the information they otherwise would have just left out.

  p With these three use cases presented we want to give you an insight of how versatile Zircel is. And be sure, there’s a lot more where that came from!
